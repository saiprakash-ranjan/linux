 * A dark resume is meant to be a reduced functionality state to resume the
 * system to. It is not meant for user interaction, but to determine whether to
 * shut down/hibernate or suspend again. This is done for power saving measures.
 * To make the experience as seamless as possible drivers may want to alter
 * their resume path to do something different in this case (prevent flashing
 * screens and blinking usb ports).
 *
 * To make this system agnostic, much of the configuration is done in user
 * space.
