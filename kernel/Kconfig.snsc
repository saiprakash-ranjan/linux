config SNSC_KTHREAD_INHERIT_CPU_AFFINITY
	bool "Make kernel threads inherit CPU affinity"
	depends on SNSC
	default n
	help
	  CPU affinity of kernel threads are not inherited by default.
	  If you enable this option, they inherit kthreadd's affinity.

config SNSC_SHIELD_KTHREADD
	bool "Allow kthreadd to be moved to non-root group"
	depends on SNSC && SNSC_KTHREAD_INHERIT_CPU_AFFINITY
	default n
	help
	  kthreadd is not allowed to non-root group by default and cannot be
	  shielded. If you enable this option, restriction on disallow
	  attaching kthreadd is removed and kthreadd can be shielded.

config SNSC_ALLOW_SET_AFFINITY_TO_UNBOUND_WQ
	bool "Allow setting affinity to unbound workqueues"
	depends on SNSC
	default n
	help
	  Usually you cannot set affinity to unbound workqueues.
	  This option eliminates the restriction.

config SNSC_POSIX_CLOCK_SNSC_RAW_CLOCK
	bool "POSIX clock support for snsc_raw_clock()"
	depends on SNSC
	default n
	help
	  This option enables special POSIX clock to be able to get a value
	  of snsc_raw_clock() from user space by clock_gettime() with special
	  clock ID (CLOCK_SNSC_RAW_CLOCK).
	  Note: CLOCK_SNSC_RAW_CLOCK is non-compliant with POSIX specification.
